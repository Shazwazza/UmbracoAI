# Create page navigation

* There must be a menu applied to all pages.
* The Home page must link to relevant pages in the site.
* Other pages must have a way to get back home.
* Navigation and menus may work contextually depending on the current page.

## Razor

* Since page navigation is a shared component, a razor partial view can be used which is stored under src/MyProject/Views/Partials
